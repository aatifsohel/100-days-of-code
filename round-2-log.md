# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Aatif Sohel]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Feb 27, Monday, 2023].

## Log

### R2D1 - Feb 27, Monday 2023
JavaScript: Started working on Bankist App project which is a fictional banking app. Today, I learned simple array methods, forEach() method with array, set and map. Added DOM element on the app page using innerHTML property & insetAdjacentHTML() method.

### R2D2 - Feb 28, Tuesday 2023
Javascript: Today, I revised yesterday's covered topics and solved a challenge based on those topics. Read MDN docs. Today, I studied 2 hours and coded for 2 hrs.

### R2D3 - Mar 01, 2023
Javascript: Today, I learned different array methods i.e. `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`. I used them in the Bankist App project to display balance and to change data from account. These 3 array methods are important (you must remember and know their use case). I practiced them on small challenges. I coded for 1 hour and 30 minutes and watched lectures for 1 hour.

### R2D4 - Mar 02, 2023
Javascript: Today, I learnt about chaining concept using `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`. I implemented this concept in the Bankist App project. I also learnt that chaining should be avoided for preventing bugs in the app. It is okay for small project but not for the big projects. I solved a small challenge in 45 minutes (which is not great since, I'm learning it took long time). I started learning Figma UI UX designing. In designing, I watched theory lectures around 1 hour. I coded for 2 hours and watched 1 hour lecture.

### R2D5 - Mar 03, 2023
Javascript: Today, I solved a challenge which uses chaining different arrar methods `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`. Learnt a new method called `.find()` which returns a first single element from the array which satisfies the condition. Implemented all of learning in the Bankist App project to enable logging functionality of the app. Used event handler, display or hide the element from the web page, disabled a default form submission behaviour using `e.preventDefault()` method in the event handler. I'm enjoying working on the project that how you can manipulate data of the web page. Learnt designing guide, sketching ideas, and where to find designs for inspiration. Today, I coded for 2 hours and watched 1 hour lectures, and watched designing lectures of ~2 hours (only theory).
