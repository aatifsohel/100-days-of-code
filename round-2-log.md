## Log

### R2D1 - Feb 27, Monday 2023
Learning JavaScript: Started working on Bankist App project which is a fictional banking app. Today, I learned simple array methods, forEach() method with array, set and map. Added DOM element on the app page using innerHTML property & insetAdjacentHTML() method.

### R2D2 - Feb 28, Tuesday 2023
Javascript: Today, I revised yesterday's covered topics and solved a challenge based on those topics. Read MDN docs. Today, I studied 2 hours and coded for 2 hrs.

### R2D3 - Mar 01, 2023
Today, I learned different array methods i.e. `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`. I used them in the Bankist App project to display balance and to change data from account. These 3 array methods are important (you must remember and know their use case). I practiced them on small challenges. I coded for 1 hour and 30 minutes and watched lectures for 1 hour.

### R2D4 - Mar 02, 2023
Today, I learnt about chaining concept using `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`. I implemented this concept in the Bankist App project. I also learnt that chaining should be avoided for preventing bugs in the app. It is okay for small project but not for the big projects. I solved a small challenge in 45 minutes (which is not great since, I'm learning it took long time). I started learning Figma UI UX designing. In designing, I watched theory lectures around 1 hour. I coded for 2 hours and watched 1 hour lecture.

### R2D5 - Mar 03, 2023
Today, I solved a challenge which uses chaining different arrar methods `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`. Learnt a new method called `.find()` which returns a first single element from the array which satisfies the condition. Implemented all of learning in the Bankist App project to enable logging functionality of the app. Used event handler, display or hide the element from the web page, disabled a default form submission behaviour using `e.preventDefault()` method in the event handler. I'm enjoying working on the project that how you can manipulate data of the web page. Learnt designing guide, sketching ideas, and where to find designs for inspiration. Today, I coded for 2 hours and watched 1 hour lectures, and watched designing lectures of ~2 hours (only theory).

### R2D6 - Mar 04, 2023
Today, I implemented loan & transfer functionality in the Bankist App project. Learnt new methods like `.findIndex()`, `.some()`, `.every`, `.flat()`, and `.flatMap()`. findIndex() method returns an index which you can use to get values from the array. some() takes a CB function if it satisfied then it returns boolean. I coded for 1 hour and 30 min & watched lectures around 1 hour. In designing, I learnt figma basics and practiced it. Explored dribble, Awwwards, pinterest, and behance web apps for design inspiration.

### R2D7 - Mar 05, 2023
Today, I learnt few JavaScript array methods which are `.sort()`, `.fill()`, `Array.from()` and `new Array()`. Implemented sorting feature in the Bankist app to sort transaction (ascending or descending). In designing, I learnt figma basic tools & techniques like how constraint works, images & importing, frames, and auto layout etc. Practiced sketching in figJam. I coded for 1 hour and 10 mins & watched 1 hours of lecture.

### R2D8 - Mar 07, 2023
Today, I completed a coding challenge on Javascript array methods. To solve this challenge I took 2 hours and took some help from the solution. I did write the code but the written code was too long. The instructor Jonas, solved this challenge in small lines of code. Now, I have to practice on array methods to understand it fully and use it different case scenario. In figma design, I practice basic design using my previous knowledge. Today, I spent on learning & coding around 4 hours.

### R2D9 - Mar 08, 2023
Today, I practiced javascript arrays from w3resources and programmiz website. Revised all the array methods. Still, I don't understand them fully but I'll practice it to understand it fully. In figma, I designed a landing page using basic knowledge of figma. I spent practicing 2 hours for coding & 3 hours for designing.

### R2D10 - Mar 10, 2023

Today I learnt about javascript math and rounding operations. Like `Math.sqrt()`, `Math.max()`, `Math.round()`, `Math.ceil()`, `Math.floor()`, `().toFixed()`, `Math.trunc()` and BigInt primitive.

### R2D12 - Mar 12, 2023
Today, I learnt about JavaScript dates, operations with dates, internationalization with numbers and dates. Implemented internationalization (Intl) number and date system in the Bankist App(project). Locale and options with `.DateTimeFormate()` & `.NumberFormat()`. Today, I studied JS whole day.

Today, I reviewed my previous learning like how DOM works and behind the scenes. Different methods and properties available to manipulate DOM. Practiced for 2 hours.

### R2D17 - Mar 18, 2023
Today, I learnt JavaScript Bubbling & Propagation. Learnt that standard DOM describes 3 phase of event propagation (i.e. capturing, target, and bubbling phase). Used `event.target`, `event.currentTarget`, `event.stopPropagation()` and `event.stopImmediatePropagation()` to see live how it actually works. To catch an event we set `capture` option to `true` default is `false`. Stopping bubbling is not a good practice because it creates hidden errors (may be we don't find out). Used this [resource](https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing) to understand it. Today, I coded for 1 hour.
