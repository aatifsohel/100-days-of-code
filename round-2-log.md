The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Feb 27, Monday, 2023].

## Log

### R2D1 - Feb 27, Monday 2023
JavaScript: Started working on Bankist App project which is a fictional banking app. Today, I learned simple array methods, forEach() method with array, set and map. Added DOM element on the app page using innerHTML property & insetAdjacentHTML() method.

### R2D2 - Feb 28, Tuesday 2023
Javascript: Today, I revised yesterday's covered topics and solved a challenge based on those topics. Read MDN docs. Today, I studied 2 hours and coded for 2 hrs.

### R2D3 - Mar 01, 2023
Javascript: Today, I learned different array methods i.e. `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`. I used them in the Bankist App project to display balance and to change data from account. These 3 array methods are important (you must remember and know their use case). I practiced them on small challenges. I coded for 1 hour and 30 minutes and watched lectures for 1 hour.
