##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 28, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've started learning front end web development through Udemy.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, learned how the internet actually works. Then started learning HTML. Covered introduction to HTML, elements, tags (opening and ending), HTML boilerplate, anchor tag and image tag. Self-closing tag and Tag omission concept. Importance of using documentations (mdn, devdocs, w3school).It took about an hour and a half. (I neglected to record my first day's progress; I'm writing this on day 2).

### Day 2: June 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate HTML.

**Thoughts** On day 2, started learning HTML tables, table head, table body, table head element, table foot element, table row, table data, etc. Although I found HTML tables to be confusing, I did practise them. Next introduction to HTML form element. It took about an hour to complete and practise.

### Day 3: June 30, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: HTML form element, input, labels

**Thoughts** On day 3, practised HTML form element, input field, and labels. With the help of MDN docs, used different input type attributes. Best practises of using form element and its use cases. HTML form element is a big topic in my opinion, coz it uses myriad types of attribute. Next Semantic HTML.
