##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 28, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've started learning front end web development through Udemy.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, learned how the internet actually works. Then started learning HTML. Covered introduction to HTML, elements, tags (opening and ending), HTML boilerplate, anchor tag and image tag. Self-closing tag and Tag omission concept. Importance of using documentations (mdn, devdocs, w3school).It took about an hour and a half. (I neglected to record my first day's progress; I'm writing this on day 2).

### Day 2: June 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Intermediate HTML.
**Thoughts** On day 2, started learning HTML tables, table head, table body, table head element, table foot element, table row, table data, etc. Although I found HTML tables to be confusing, I did practise them. Next introduction to HTML form element. It took about an hour to complete and practise.
